On the other hand, the Dublin list contains the following
names which are not in the Drummond (lastle Oalendar. I

¹ again arrange them chronologically, and add notes from Ado,

which in some cases may account for their non-appearance in
our list ; but it will have been observed that several that are

Marty1·ology,that is, in additions made by subsequent revisens
of it; and there are many more such among the names of
other saints, not bishops of Rome; so that much stress cannot
be laid upon this. Besides, after making all allowances, there
are several names, such 88 Alexander, Leo I, and Mark, whom
we can hardly suppose to have been omitted on purpose or
from any definite rule.

Omitting Hegesippus (7 April) who is wrongly called pope,
there are 24 names; but one of these I cannot identify in the

absence of sufficient particulare.
