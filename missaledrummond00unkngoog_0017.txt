gui-‘le for Advent.

The Oslendar iuelf hu been compilet] from three sources ;
n western Mnrtyrolugy, substantislly that of Ado3 s. second
Continental Mnrtyrology, which hs· furnished s, few items
which are distinguished frum the rest by being introduced
with some such phrase ns ‘ut fertur' or *ut quidam ferunt;·
though probably s guod many of the simple deviatione from
that of Adu are due to this source; sud thir-ily, n list of Irish
saints, whose names hardly ever precede those of the Gon-
tineam lists.

All 1 cau ssy st present of the second uf these, is that it
nlmnst always agrees with the Felire of Aenghus the Ouldee.
Eut several curious questions are raised by the first, which
constitutes the basis uf this Galeudsr.

I have to thsnk Mn· W- F. Skene for my acquaintance
with ‘⁴ The Book of Obits snd Martyrology of Christ Church,
Dubliu¹¹ edited in 1844 for the Irish Archaenlugieal Society
by ΜΓ Orosthwsite and Dr Todd. The Martyrologyit contains
resembles very closely that in the Drummond Osstle Missal,
even in wnrding; su thst the two belong strictly to the sume
famil .

Τὴζ clossness uf the vex-bal agreement between them will
bs at unce seen nn oum Μῆτις the quotatinns I hsve made
in the margin from this ubliu list; but their resl force esu
only be apprecisted by comparing these two Calenam· with
the printed edition of Ado's Mmymlogy by Geni-gius, taken
from Continents] MSS. and seeing the much greater varistions
in it.

But the fact that there must have been sn Irish reeensinn
of Ado, which ssi-ved ss a basis both to the Dublin aud to the
Drummond Gsstle lists, will appear from this circumstance
also; that in not s few inmunes they agree in substantia]
dsviations from Ado's text, ss for instance, in transferring
names to s. different dsy. 1 regn-ez that in the marginal notes
1 have not always pointed this out, especially in the earlier
months, having st first taken too litei-any Dr Todd's statement
that the list he published was—
in cm ane Mnityrology or Ado, with considerable „tn-mgnum ud some
uiditiuus. (p. lii)

This resemblance between the nnn-Itish portion uf our
Cslendsr and that in the Duhlin msrtyrulogy, becomes more
carious from the circumstance, that the latter was not designed
