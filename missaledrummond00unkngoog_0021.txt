Some account may now be given of the Calendars which

here printed, and of the contractioris by which they bave been
dellglldlieodtes the Felire of Aenghus the Culdee, which seems

tc agree more closely with our MS. than any other tc which Ι «

have had aceess. lt has only been published in a lithographed
fac-simile of the Leabhar Breae, preserved in the Royal
Irish Academy, which is more adapted to Irish scholare than
tc ordinary students of Hagiology; but Dr Whitley Stokes has
for some years been engaged on an edition of it in ordinary

T, the Martyrology of 'Pamhlacht already referred t0,
printed at Dublin, apparently in 1857. l have seldom used
