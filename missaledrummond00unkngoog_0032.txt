Presaca xxi

Aetne end is a remarkable mutual salutabion in the Gaelic
language between S. Ciaran and S. (loemghin (Keria), show-
ing how much even in a book of Liturgical ServiceS, the devo·
tion of the Celtic race was tinctured with personal veneration.

Oocmqin dicit.

Is mochen a noeb chlerig,

A meio Luagne lan ainglich,

Is cian at'a in tairngere‚

Do thiachbain dom chill,

Sluag Lagea nos lesaigfe,

Do nim duit ro thromchinned,

In cis adbol anacea,

Dingbai dib go grinn.

Cicron Saiyre dicit.

A Ohoemgin, a chlochadbaig,
A mil De co firinnc, a thor circo narchainglib,
A chenn nenaid s6erchr'abuid, ruln immutsu
Mo chridc‚ cipe ro da fessa dem lugu is mochen.
As mochen.

(Coemyin said .·
Thou art welcome‚ holy cleric,
Thou son of Lughne, full, angelic,
Lcng has it been in prophecy
Thy coming to my church3
The hosts of Lcinsber thou will instruci;
I make for thee a heavy command,
The weighty unwonted tribute
Ward off from them acceptably.

Cicron of Saiyhir said .·

Ooembgin, thou mature rock,

Thou Ohampion of God, with truth, thou lower of gold
with archangele,

Thou head cf noble picus synode, to mc thou art the se-
cret of my beart. Ι

Whoever would desire ’to know, by my vow thou ari wel-
come.

Thou art welcome.)
