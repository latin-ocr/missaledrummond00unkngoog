Presacc. xix

[Thus far this Preface was in type before the ‹leath of
Mr. Forbes. What more be intended to write there is no
means of knowing, as he has not left any MS. beyond the
Notes which are embodied in the Table of Additions and Cor·
rectione, and which were no doubt intended to form part of
the fSupplementary Annotations referred to on page iv. of this
Pre ace.

Since the present Missal was printed, another ancient Irish
Missal-that belonging to Corpus Christi Oollege, Oxford-
has been published under the ¹aide editorship of the Rev. F. E. ,
Warren, B.D. Had Mr. Forbes lived to'see its publication,
he would no doubt have taken notice of it, either in the Pre-
face itself or in the Supplementary Annotations‚ and might
have been tempted to institute a comparison between it and
the present Missal. This, however desirable, his literary
executor has not ventured to do; especially as he conceives
that such a work had better be deferred until the other
ancient Irish Missals-the Stowe and the Rosslyn—are in the
hands of the public.

It may be well to state that in the original manuscript the
Calendar precedes the Missal, although, for some reason un-
known to the writer of these lines, it is in this edition placed
at the end. .

Some apology ought to be made for the long delay in the -
appearance of the Volume. Owing to various circumstances,
which it is ncedless to specify, this delay has been unavoid-
able.

For the Index, and for a few Notes within brackets in the
Table of Additions and Oorrections, the present writer is alone
res onsible.

Tphanks are due to all who have kindly aidod in the work.
Το the Lord Willoughby de Eresby for the loan of the Missal,
and to the Right Rev. A. P. Forhes, D.O.L., Bishop of Brechin,
for much valuable help, this tribute would gladly have been
paid; but they have gone to their rest. It only remains, then,
for the writer, in the name of his deceased friend G. H. Forbes,

and in his own, to offer most cordial thanks to the Very Rev. ·

William Reeves, D.D., Dean of Armagh3 to W. F. Skene,
Esq, LL.D., Dea, Her Majesty's Historiographer for Scot-
land3 and to J. Τ. Gilbert, Esq, ot' the Royal lrish Academy,
for the great assistance they have rendered during the pro-
gress of the work; and also to the Lady Willoughby de Eresby
for permission to consult the manuscript after the book had
been printed3 and to any others who may have helped in the
work, but whose names are unknown to the writer.
